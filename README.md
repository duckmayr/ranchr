`ranchr` provides data and functions to help you breed great monsters in
the game [Monster Rancher
2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Rancher_2).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ranchr` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("duckmayr/ranchr")
```

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Kurasu Soratobu, whose “Monster Rancher: Combining
FAQ” provided the necessary data and information to make this package
possible; I appreciate his willingness to let me publish his data.
Please see the file `inst/COPYRIGHTS` for relevant copyright
information.

## Discrepancies

The data for Kurasu’s guide were compiled several years ago for the
PlayStation version of Monster Rancher 2. It’s *possible* that some
things have changed when they ported the game to iOS, Nintendo Switch,
and PC. If you notice anything that seems off, just [open and
issue](https://github.com/duckmayr/ranchr/issues) and let me know.
